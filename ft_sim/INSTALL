BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR FRINGE TRACKING SIMULATOR

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The fringe tracking simulator has been developed and tested under
Linux. The Ubuntu distribution is recommended because the required
libraries are available as packages, but any other distribution should
work.

It should be straightforward to port the simulator to other unix-like
operating systems.


PREREQUISITES

You will need C and C++ compilers (the simulator has been built
successfully using gcc/g++ 4.3).

The following libraries must be installed:

- CFITSIO  (Ubuntu package libcfitsio3-dev)
- FFTW 3.x  (Ubuntu package libfftw3-dev)


BUILDING

The supplied Makefile uses pkg-config to locate FFTW. If your system
does not use pkg-config for FFTW, you may need to edit the top section
of the Makefile. The paths to the CFITSIO library files are hard-coded
into the Makefile, and may need to be edited for your system.

After making any necessary adjustments to the Makefile, run make. This
will generate an executable called 'simulator'.
