BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISIBILITY SIMULATOR

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The visibility simulator has been developed and tested under
Linux. The Ubuntu distribution is recommended because the required
libraries are available as packages, but any other distribution should
work.

It should be straightforward to port the simulator to other unix-like
operating systems.


PREREQUISITES

You will need C and C++ compilers (the simulator has been built
successfully using gcc/g++ 4.3).

The following libraries must be installed:

- CFITSIO  (Ubuntu package libcfitsio3-dev)
- GTK+ 2.12 or newer  (Ubuntu package libgtk2.0-dev)
- FFTW 3.x  (Ubuntu package libfftw3-dev)


BUILDING

The supplied Makefile uses pkg-config to locate GTK+ and FFTW. If
your system does not use pkg-config for these libraries, you may need
to edit the top section of the Makefile. The paths to the CFITSIO
library files are hard-coded into the Makefile, and may need to be
edited for your system.

After making any necessary adjustments to the Makefile, run make. This
will generate an executable called 'vsim'. To test the program, run
'make check'.


USAGE

If you run 'vsim' without command-line arguments, a simple GUI is
displayed. This allows you to specify several text files containing
the simulation parameters. Alternatively the text filenames may be
supplied on the vsim command line, followed by the name of the desired
output OIFITS file.

Example parameter files (*.txt) are supplied. These contain comments
explaining the meaning of the parameters. Note that currently the
parameter files should not contain blank lines.
