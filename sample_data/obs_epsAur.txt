# This is a descriptive simulation file for complex observations with a single instrument at a single array.
# Multiple baseline configurations are allowable as long as the telescope positions are defined in
# the array definition file.

# An observation consists of three required tags, hour_angle, telescopes, and exclude:
#   hour_angle = the hour angle at which the observation was conducted as a decimal number
#   telescopes = a comma separated list of telescope names involved in the observation 
#   (as defined in the array config file)
#   exclude = a comma separated list of hyphen-separated baselines (i.e. excluding the 
#   baseline between S1 and E1 is S1-E1).  Exclude may be empty.
# Samples:

# Start off with S1E1W1W2 but S1-E1 and S1-W1 were not trackable (but S1-W2 is still okay)
