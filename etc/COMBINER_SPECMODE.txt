# This is a template file for a spectral mode of a combiner.

# The name of the combiner to which this mode belongs.  The code enforces that
# the combiner and the spectral mode must match.
combiner = text

# A name for this spectral mode.
mode = text

# Lastly the spectral bins and effective bandwidth written as one entry per line

#   mean_wavelength effective_bandwidth
# The effective bandwidth should be computed per the OIFITS file format specifications.  
# The ordering of these entries does not matter.
