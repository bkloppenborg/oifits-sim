This directory contains definition files for arrays, combiners, and spectral modes for the combiners.

The code is setup to permit users to specify their own array, combiners, and spectral modes.  It will
first check for the existance of a file with the same name specified on the command line.  If that fails,
it will search this directory for similarly named files.  Because of this we have to enforce a naming
convention on the files.  

Generically we follow this naming convention:

ARRAY.txt
COMBINER.txt
COMBINER_SPECMODE.txt

For example, if you want to use CHARA with MIRC in LowH mode, the program will search for 
CHARA.txt, MIRC.txt and MIRC_LowH.txt
