# This is a template for array definition files.  
# A few notes first:
# * A line with comments begins with a "#"
# * The named parameters (foo = something) do not need to be specified in any particular order
# * The telescope definitions must be the last parameters in the file.

# The name of the array
name = text

# The array latitute (deg), longitude (deg), and altitude (meters)
lat = float
lon = float
alt = float

# The coord line describes the coordinate system used for the telescope.  In most cases
# you should use the APIS++ standard (used in OIFITS files).
#   0 : (x,y,z) per APIS++ standards (i.e. OIFITS coordinates)
#   1 : North, East, Up
coord = integer

# An estimation for the throughput up to the combiner (i.e. just the throughput of the array).
# Actual values here are good, but theoretical computations based upon transmission/reflection
# should be fine as well.
# 0 <= throughput <= 1.0
throughput = float

# An estimation for the average wind velocity in units of m/s
wind_speed = float

# An estimation for the average seeing value on-site given at 500 nm in units of meters.
r0 = float

# Lastly a list of telescopes with one telescope on each line.  Columns are 
# white-space separated and consist of seven columns in the following order
#   1: The array's name for the station (text)
#   2: The array's index for the station (integer)
#   3: The X/North Coordinate for the station (float, meters)
#   4: The Y/East Coordinate for the station (float, meters)
#   5: The Z/Up Coordinate for the station (float, meters)
#   6: The Gain (float, 0 <= gain <= 1).  Set to 1 unless you have a good reason
#   7: The Diamemeter of the mirror (float, meters)
# An example of this format for CHARA (APIS++ standard definition)
