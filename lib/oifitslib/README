                      OIFITSlib Release Notes

                    John Young <jsy1001@cam.ac.uk>

WHAT IS OIFITSlib?

OIFITSlib is a C library for input/output, merging, filtering and
checking of optical/IR interferometry datasets in the OIFITS exchange
format.

The table-level input/output code (see exchange.h) in OIFITSlib is
derived from the previously-released "OIFITS example software in C",
and provides the same Application Programming Interface
(API). OIFITSlib provides a file-level API built on top of the
table-level code, containing functions to read and write an entire
OIFITS file (see oifile.h).

Command-line utilities oifits-merge, oifits-filter and oifits-check
are also provided - these provide simple user interfaces to
OIFITSlib routines.

A python interface to OIFITSlib is also provided (created using
SWIG). To build this you will need SWIG 1.3.

GETTING THE SOFTWARE

The source code for OIFITSlib is available from the OIFITS website:
http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/research/OAS/oi_data/oifits.html#resources


BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

Use the supplied Makefile, which requires Gnu Make (sometimes
installed as gmake). You may have to add explicit search paths to the
Makefile variables INCFLAGS, PYINCFLAGS, LDLIBS and LDLIBS_GLIB in
order to find all the required include files and libraries.

The following libraries are required:
- CFITSIO (version 3.x recommended):
  http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html
- GLib    (version 2.6 or later recommended):
  http://www.gtk.org/

Note that the "oitable" module can be built without GLib. The supplied
Makefile attempts to detect whether and where GLib is installed (using
the pkg-config utility). If GLib is not detected or pkg-config is not
installed, only liboitable and its demonstration program "demo" will
be built.

OIFITSlib has been tested under Linux and Solaris. The author is
interested in hearing about successes or failures under other
operating systems.


DOCUMENTATION

The documentation for OIFITSlib is supplied in HTML format. Point your
web browser to the file doc/index.html

The HTML documentation is automatically generated from comments
in the C code using doxygen.

The command-line utilities oifits-merge, oifits-filter, and
oifits-check will output brief usage information if invoked with the
'--help' argument.

The python interface is documented using python docstrings generated
from SWIG interface files. Use pydoc to view the documentation for the
oifits, oicheck, oimerge and oifilter modules.
