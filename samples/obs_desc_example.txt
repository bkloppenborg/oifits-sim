# This file describes the descriptive type of observation file.
# The goal of this observation type is to permit the most flexibility for
# observation planning.

# Much like the basic hour-angle case, the first parameter specified in the
# file must be the type (1 = DESCRIPTIVE)
type = 1

# The remainder of the file consists of a series of blocks describing the observations
# there are three commands:
hour_angle = -1.234
telescopes = S1,S2,E1,E2,W1,W2

hour_angle = -0.51
telescopes = S1,E1,E2,W1,W2
exclude = E1-W1
