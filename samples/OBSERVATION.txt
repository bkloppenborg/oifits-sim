# There are three ways one may specify observations.  The easiest one is via. command line:
#  oifits-sim ... -obs --start float --every float --end float [--T string]
# which uses the telescopes (--T) specified to sample the target at the interval (in hours)
# specified.  See the documentation for detailed description of how to use this mode.

# The other methods involve observation files.  There are two type of observation files. 
# the first is an extension of the command line option (useful for simulating the data
# collected over several nights) and the second is a "descriptive" method which permits
# full control of hour angles and telescopes used.  Samples of both types can be found
# in the samples directory.
