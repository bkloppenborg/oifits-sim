# This file describes the descriptive type of observation file.
# The goal of this observation type is to permit the most flexibility for
# observation planning.

# Much like the basic hour-angle case, the first parameter specified in the
# file must be the type (1 = DESCRIPTIVE)
type = 1

# The remainder of the file consists of a series of blocks describing the observations
# there are three commands:
hour_angle = float
telescopes = string
exclude = string
   
# where the exclude line is (entirely) optional.  There is no limit on the number
# of blocks permitted in the file.  Examples of these files are in the samples directory.

# The parameters are as follows:
# hour_angle = float
#  This is the hour angle at which the observation is planned to occur.

# telescopes = string
#  A comma separated list of the telescopes used in this observation.  For example:
#  telescopes = S1,E1,W1,W2
#  would create all baselines and triplets from the four telescopes S1, E1, W1, and W2

# exclude = string
#  This keyword permits the user to exclude baselines from being included in the
#  observation.  This is a comma separated, hyphen-delineated list of telescopes.
#  For example, to include all telescopes at CHARA but exclude the baseline formed
#  by E1 and W1 as well as S1 and W1 we would specify:
#   telescopes = S1,S2,E1,E2,W1,W2
#   exclude = E1-W1,S1-W1
